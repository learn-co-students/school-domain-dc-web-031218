  # The roster should be an empty hash upon initialization but will
  # be built out to contain keys of grade levels. The value of each
  # key will be an array of student names.

  # You should be able to add a student to the school by calling the
  # add_student method and giving it an argument of the student's name
  # and their grade.

  # You should be able to get a sorted list of all the students where the
  # strings in the student arrays are sorted alphabetically.
